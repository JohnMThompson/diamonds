# diamonds

This is my first try at some regression using Python. 

This app is an attempt to estimate the prices of my girlfriend's potential engagement ring. 

I downloaded sever local jewelers' data about oval diamonds and then tried my first random forest regression. 

I first tested the regression in Alteryx as a proof of concept before coming to Python and coding it.
