# diamonds

This app is an attempt to estimate the prices of my girlfriend's potential engagement ring. 

I downloaded several local jewelers' data about oval diamonds and then tried my first random forest regression. 

I first tested the regression in Alteryx as a proof of concept before coming to Python and coding it. 

~This app is deployed on Heroku at the following link:~

The app is no longer deployed after heroku discontinued the free app tier. 

Edit: We got married, the ring cost only 3% more than my app estimated!
